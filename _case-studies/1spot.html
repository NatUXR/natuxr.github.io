            I was interested in exploring accessibility focused mobility solutions, specifically for those who needed information to be delivered in alternative modalities (visually, editorially, tactically, etc.). We sought to explore ways to make information necessary for transportation (walking, busing, ride sharing) available in modalities other than sight.

                     Most mobile devices come with assistive technologies already built in. These include: screen readers, dictation tools, and haptic feedback. These make phones and smart watches very accessible. Blind and visually impaired communities already heavily utilize technology, so these devices are already present in their lives.

            <p>
               The course was structured like a design sprint as to help us generate ideas and find direction within our chosen area of focus. Once we settled on a specific issue to address we utilized design thinking and human-centered design methodologies to further develop our projects (until we had a minimal viable product).

         <h3>Research</h3>
         <p>
            I began by conducting a literature review to gain a high-level overview /understanding of the relationship between/ world of BVI communities and mobility. I then looked at products, services, and projects that were being used by, or developed for the BVI community, to see how they handled/addressed mobility challenges/the challenge of mobility. I used both of these to inform and structure my interviews with members of the BVI community.

                  In the discovery phase I looked at research from academic publications, national research councils, and government organizations to gain a high-level view of the relationship between/world of BVI communities and mobility.
                  <br><br>
                  From this I sought to understand what kinds of mobility challenges BVI communities were encountering, and the state of current mobility(, travel, and navigation) strategies.

               <p>
                  In addition to understanding current strategies, I looked at what mobility tools & resources existed, and what was (actually) being utilized by the BVI community. 
                  <br>
                  I examined and compared (solutions offered by) a dozen products, services, and projects that directly and indirectly addressed the challenge of mobility(, travel, and navigation) for the BVI.
                  <br>
                  I examined and compared (solutions offered by) a dozen products and services that were already/actively being used by the community, and projects that were exploring or building new tools (and solutions).
                  <br>
                  Additionally, I wanted to know what worked well, if those solutions had any disadvantages, or (if they) were they missing or failing to solve anything.
                  <br>
                  Evaluating the "advantages and shortcomings"/ strengths and weaknesses of each (strategy/approach) allowed me/us to identify common practices/approaches, gaps, and opportunities for improvement.

               <h4>
                  Primary research: evaluative
               </h4>
               <p>
                  By looking at people’s lived experiences, the available resources, and the gap between the two, I was able to gain a clearer picture of what that gap lacked.
                  <br>
                  With that information my next step was to talk to people in the community, with more specific/targeted questions & gain a further understanding of X.
               </p>
      
               <h5>1st round of Interviews </h5>
               <p>
                  To gain a further understanding of X/ more nuanced/intimate understanding of their lived experiences...
                  </br>
                  I then moved on to user interviews, speaking with BVI people from San Diego and beyond. Across varying abilities, lifestyles, and locations, I was able to identify several common challenges and pain points involving mobility faced by my sample group. Many of these themes were also echoed in my earlier literature reviews.

                     <li>
                        The most easily and financially accessible strategies do not convey rich environmental information. So a user might know what is immediately around them, but not much beyond that if they are not familiar with the area

                           Our blind and visually impaired community collaborators identified walking as a primary mode of travel, along with public transportation
                           <ul>
                              <li>
                                 It is relied heavily on, especially as a way to facilitate other modes of transportation (e.g. buses, trains, medical transportation)
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 Typically, walking is only done in places that the BVI individual is familiar enough with to possess a mental maps, which they can use to navigate 
                              </li>
                           </ul>

                           <strong>White cane users</strong> are able to detect obstacles in their path. Whereas <strong>guide dog users</strong> are led around obstacles and are not made aware of them. Each tool produces a different understanding of the user's immediate environment

                        <li>
                           Most other information is attained through GPS and applications that provide directions, or technologies designed to interpret the environment for the user through a variety of means [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
                        </li>

                           Research has identified barriers (e.g. poorly maintained sidewalks, obstructions, lack of pathways) in the pedestrian environment to walking as a major issue, and our collaborators also expressed a desire for increased walkability (Harkey, et al., 2007).

                        For each tool I compared/looked at
                        a number of factors, including: the
                        <strong>quality of information</strong>,
                        <strong>presence of information on pedestrian barriers</strong>,
                        <strong>accessible design</strong> &
                        <strong>ease of use</strong>,
                        <strong>cost</strong>,
                        <strong>availability</strong>,
                        <strong>integration with public transit</strong>, if the
                        <strong>information delivery method was discreet</strong> and the tool
                        <strong>enabled independence</strong>.

                        No tool fully addressed all areas of concern. Those that came close lacked crucial information on pedestrian accessibility and environmental barriers, while those that provided it were limited to short sessions of guidance from another person.

                           <strong>Google Maps</strong> and <strong>Project Sidewalk</strong> collected environmental information that was constantly available to users via an app or web browser, and free to use. The richness of the environmental information varied in quality for both, and required the user to find the exact information they needed in a large.
                           
                           <strong>Google Maps</strong> provided the most comprehensive information in terms of navigation, travel, and public transit, but was missing some crucial accessibility information (state of sidewalks, presence of ramps or truncated dome mats, obstacles or parking lots, etc.). While <strong>Project Sidewalk</strong> used "crowdsourcing, computer vision, and online map imagery" to create a web based map that was specifically focused on the accessible navigability of the environment (presence of curb ramps, surface problems, obstacles, and lack of sidewalks), but limited to a small community.

                           <strong>Aira</strong> and <strong>Be My Eyes </strong>connected BVI users with an agent to help them do a multitude of tasks, including navigating their environments, finding out or reading public transit schedules, finding taxis or ride shares, in real time. Both were limited to the duration of a phone or video call, and required working with a sighted individual to provide environmental information. <strong>Be My Eyes</strong> was free, but it required the user to point their phone camera at the environment or object, while <strong>Aira</strong> started at $300 but was more discreet through the use of Google Glasses and potentially headphones.

                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           Our blind and visually impaired community collaborators identified walking as a primary mode of travel, along with public transportation
                           <ul>
                              <li>
                                 It is relied heavily on, especially as a way to facilitate other modes of transportation (e.g. buses, trains, medical transportation)
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 Typically, walking is only done in places that the BVI individual is familiar enough with to possess a mental maps, which they can use to navigate 
                              </li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <strong>White cane users</strong> are able to detect obstacles in their path. Whereas <strong>guide dog users</strong> are led around obstacles and are not made aware of them. Each tool produces a different understanding of the user's immediate environment
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Most other information is attained through GPS and applications that provide directions, or technologies designed to interpret the environment for the user through a variety of means [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

                           <strong>Unfamiliar places are difficult to orient in and navigate</strong>, as such BVI individuals do not often travel to new places. This greatly increases the difficulty of completing tasks essential to everyday life or one’s health, such as going to a doctor’s appointment, finding and maintaining social support, shopping for groceries, as well finding and maintaining employment.
                           <br>
                           <strong>This hurts not only the individual but the city they reside in, as the capital they could generate and spend is significantly reduced.</strong> Those in the BVI community often have very small social networks and support because of transportation challenges, decreasing mental and emotional wellbeing (Bascom, 2017) – another source of lost capital. In addition, insights or innovations BVI individuals could bring to spaces/areas such as businesses, academia, or the art world are greatly hindered or lost.

                           Understandably, <strong>places demand pre-planning</strong>. The information needed to do so for walking includes: the availability of sidewalks, what a street crossing is like, if there are crosswalks and accessible technology along the route, the presence of parking lots, and unexpected events, like construction, that may close off sidewalks. <strong>None of this information is readily available</strong> to those who might need it?/ users, and even when they are in the environment, they often have no way of getting this information unless they ask others around them (which is burdensome, and many do not want to do).

                           Making this information available is key to enabling individuals to remain independent and mobile. Lack of either or both interferes with the ability to find or maintain a job, fulfill basic tasks like going grocery shopping or going to the doctors, and even maintain a network of social support. This helps people remain mobile and independent; making such essential tasks much safer and efficient.

                           Most importantly, it brings more diverse individuals into spaces they did not or could not access readily before. And diversity of ideas in these spaces is what makes San Diego a leader and the unique place it is. Spot isn’t just for those who need accessible routes, or even tourists who want to know where they can walk around San Diego, Spot is for San Diego (and everyone in it).

         Transition
         <p>
            Our research findings provided me/us with direction & informed our future questions. I based the wireframes, prototypes & next round of interviews off the question of: If environmental information isn't available, how can we get/attain/collect that information & how can we deliver it? (move to below?)

      <section class="spa-slide" id="designI">
         <h3>Design & Test I</h3>
         <p>
            Using our insights we moved onto ideation & begin exploring possible solutions.
            <br>
            With each X/point (Sketches & storyboarding + prototype) we sought to ask a question, & X
            <br>
            – at each point present a question you had, how the prototype sought to learn about it/answer it & where it failed & how that helped you create the next iteration/version
         </p>

         <h4>Storyboarding & Prototyping</h4>

         <h5>1st round - Explored presenting information through modalities other than sight</h5>
         <p>
            <strong>Note/Challenge:</strong> Due to project requirements, the first prototype was designed specifically for sighted users in or to illustrate the concept, and to receive feedback on. All features were designed knowing the needs of the blind and visually impaired were different than those of sighted users.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Prototyped different ways people could interact with the world, find orientation in physical place and get information about the space around them
            </li>
            <li>
               Created low fidelity bracelet that applied pressure or haptic feedback to communicate direction, or obstacles
            </li>
            <li>
               Storyboarded smart bus stops that could link with user’s personal devices to convey travel information auditorily
            </li>
         </ul>

         Results
         <ul>
            <li>
               Helped me to understand that I needed to find out: what information users needed and didn’t have access to, and what modality was the most helpful way to present it
            </li>
            <li>
               Follow up interviews with accessible designer and community members pointed out the appeal of smart phones and smart watches because they fulfill communities desire to blend in and not stand out
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h5>2nd round - Explored ways to convey the most impactful and useful information</h5>
         <p>
            <strong>Note/Challenge:</strong> The second prototype is useable by both sighted and blind or individual impaired individuals. It is compatible with screen readers, prioritizes voice commands, arranges tasks and information is a linear fashion that is easier to use for the BVI and is good practice in accessible design. As most BVI individuals often use their technology in curtain mode (the screen off) it would be built to function by voice and gesture alone.
            <br>
            It would make robust/particular/strong use of Apple's array of assistive gestures and other assistive technologies (https://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision/) as much of the BVI community in San Diego already use or prefer this ecosystem.
            <br>
            The prototype is also designed so that it may be used by others with accessibility needs not related to sight. Those in a wheelchair or those who are deaf, for example, may also make use of the information if desired.
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               Storyboarded a user experience with an application that provided navigation and environmental information
            </li>
         </ul>

         Results
         <ul>
            <li>
               Follow up interviews confirmed the information was meaningful and not easily available elsewhere
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h4>Wireframes & Prototypes</h4>
         <h5>3rd round - Experimented with ways to convey and represent the information</h5>
         <p>
            <strong>Note/Challenge:</strong> Designed specifically for sighted users (in X) as to illustrate the concept and to receive feedback on. All features were designed knowing the needs of the blind and visually impaired were different than those of sighted users.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Created a low fidelity, linear prototype. You can try it here: https://xd.adobe.com/view/7666f569-33bf-41dc-80e0-427764e30b2f
            </li>
         </ul>

         Results
         <ul>
            <li>
               Helped us to understand the weak points in the design and make a 2nd iteration that was more assistive technology friendly
            </li>
            <li>
               User testing pointed to displays and flows that were unclear, and ways in which larger community is not aware of currently existing accessible technologies
            </li>
            <li>
               Helped me to understand that we needed to further explain what it meant to design for the blind and visually impaired community, and what best practices were, when communicating our design to others
            </li>
         </ul>


         <h5>4th + 5th rounds - Asked if application form was the right medium and if information had gaps </h5>
         <p>
            <strong>Note/Challenge:</strong> Designed specifically for sighted users in as to illustrate the concept, and to receive feedback on. All features were designed knowing the needs of the blind and visually impaired were different than those of sighted users.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Iterated on the previous prototype. Saya directed/led the creation of a higher fidelity, interactive prototype
            </li>
            <li>
               This version responded to user input and was navigable, as opposed to the linear path of the previous version, allowing users to have a more natural experience
            </li>
            <li>
               Was designed around accessibility: all features were designed knowing the needs of the blind and visually impaired were different than those of sighted users. As such it was built to be compatible with screen readers and prioritize voice commands, and options, tasks and information was arranged in a linear fashion that is easier to use for the BVI and is good practice in accessible design. As most BVI individuals often use their technology in curtain mode (the screen off) it would be built to function by voice and gesture alone if needed.

            <p>
               Pitch video: https://biteable.com/watch/spot-1589551
               <br>
               We propose to provide this information through Spot, a navigation application? dedicated to providing accessible walking routes/ providing accessibility-focused walking directions. With Spot we can bring environmental information the user needs to them in an accessible format. It would allow routes to be planned beforehand or on the go. Most importantly, it would not replace a white cane or seeing eye dog but supplement it.
               <br>
               An “accessible route” means that it considers things like the presence of sidewalks or dangerous unstructured crossings like parking lots, if those spaces are actually utilized for walking, and could alert users to real-time changes, such as path obstructions from construction--all things that existing navigation technologies cannot and do not do.
               <br><br>
            </p>
               <h5>How we get the environmental data</h5>
            <p>
               In partnership with GE, San Diego recently installed over 3,000 smart streetlamps in the downtown area. These/They collect a multitude of data streams, including traffic activity, vehicle speed, parking spaces, auditory information, weather conditions and where and when pedestrians are active.
               <br>
               Using pedestrian activity data, we would generate a score that ranks the walkability of an area, both historically and in real time. Scores can then be used to generate accessible routes, as well as notify users of day-to-day changes, like/such as closed sidewalks. To cover gaps in data the community would be able to provide information as well; for example, if there is a heavily walked route, but it is not on a sidewalk.
               <br>
