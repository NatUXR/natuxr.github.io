<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I am a junior user researcher and ethnographer.
<br><br>
My background is in Sociocultural Anthropology and Cognitive Science, a combination that lays a strong foundation for interdisciplinary work. Both disciplines have their own unique perspectives on, and approaches to, understanding people and why they do the things they do. They each look at subjects at different scales: neurologically, individually, culturally, globally, and temporally. The key is that both disciplines always provide a context to the subject. I've applied that mindset and the skills from those disciplines to human-centered design projects, both professionally and academically.
<br><br>
I am driven by learning and growth, and always looking to refine established skills and attain new ones. I believe multidisciplinary approaches and cross-functional teams produce the thoroughest picture of whatever you are trying to understand.
<br><br>
I  am available for freelance work, and open to side projects. If you would like a more comprehensive overview of my experience you can see more details on my <a href="">Linkedin</a>.
